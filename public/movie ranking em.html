<h1>MOST LOVED MOVIES BY KING NUEL</h1>
<h2>My Top 5 MOVIES Currently</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Stranger Things</h3>
<p>This is my most favourite series, because it lays emphasis on family and friends and the people that care and matter to you.<br /> It also teaches about the extent that which you will go for the one you love no matter the consequences.<br /> It tells the young to explore and learn new things and broaden their imagination</p>
<h3>The 100</h3>
<p>This movie teaches us about second chance in life, about how we shouldn't judge<br /> people  based on what we have heard about them but get to know them.<br /> the technology of the movie was good too.</p>
<h3>Altered Carbon</h3>
<p>This movie used good technological and scenerios factors to explain how life works.</p>
<h3>Creed</h3>
<p>This movie is all about redemption, loosing and finding yourself.</p>
<h3>Living In Bondage</h3>
<p>My favourite Nollywood movie (nigeria movie) portrays the typical african man<br /> willing to do whatsoever it takes to get wealth and he is forced to make drastic<br /> decisions too, it also teaches about love, contententment family and to the extent greed can carry a man.</p>
